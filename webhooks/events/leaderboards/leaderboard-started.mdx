openapi: webhook leaderboard.started
---

<Note>
  Events fire at 10:00 UTC the day before the leaderboard's UTC start time. This
  is because leaderboard runs are relative to each user's time zone, and the
  start event must fire before users in the most advanced time zones begin
  ranking. **Make sure to take into account users' time zones if scheduling
  notifications from this webhook event**.
