openapi: webhook leaderboard.finished
---

<Note>
  Events fire between 13:00-13:59 UTC the day following the end of a leaderboard
  run. This is because each leaderboard run is relative to each user's time
  zone, and users in the most delayed time zones must be given the chance to
  finish.
</Note>

<Note>
  Events only include the top 10 user rankings. To fetch more, use the [single
  leaderboard API](/api-reference/endpoints/leaderboards/get-leaderboard).
