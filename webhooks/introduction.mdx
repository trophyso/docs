Trophy has support for a number of webhooks that fire based on key events such as `achievement.completed`, `leaderboard.finished` and `streak.lost`.

These events allow you to trigger custom code and power extended gamification experiences using Trophy data.

All Trophy webhooks are delivered over HTTP which allows customers to subscribe to receive data from Trophy via regular HTTP `POST` requests.
