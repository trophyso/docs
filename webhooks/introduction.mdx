Trophy has support for a number of webhooks that fire based on key events such as:

- `achievement.completed`
- `leaderboard.finished`
- `streak.lost`
- and many more...

These events allow you to trigger custom code to power extended gamification experiences using Trophy data.

Common use cases include:

- Triggering custom emails and push notification sequences
- Data warehousing
- Powering non-gamification related workflows like subscription updates and feature management.

All Trophy webhooks are delivered over HTTP which allows customers to subscribe to receive data from Trophy via regular HTTP `POST` requests.
