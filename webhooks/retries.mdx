Trophy will automatically retry any event that fails for one of the following reasons:

- Timeout: If your webhook endpoint does not respond within 60 seconds.
- Network error: If your webhook endpoint is unreachable due to network issues.
- HTTP status code: If your webhook endpoint responds with a `non-2XX` HTTP status code.

<Note>
  Trophy will automatically retry events up to 3 times exponentially starting
  with a 1 minute interval.
