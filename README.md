# Trophy Documentation

Our documentation is built on top of [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com). We welcome contributions for fixing small issues such as typos and for adding new or updating existing content that you think would help others.

### Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command:

```
npm i -g mintlify
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where docs.json is):

```
npm run dev
```

### Structure

Our docs are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which if you haven't used it before is a bit if markdown and React had a baby.

See the [full guide](https://mintlify.com/docs/content/components) from Mintlify on writing MDX and the components that are available for how best to contribute.
