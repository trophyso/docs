## Why Trophy

If your goal is for your users to create a regular habit of using your app—to learn something, publish content, or even exercise—gamification could be for you.

It's been proven by the likes of Duolingo and others to predictably boost retention and increase platform engagement.

But building gamification at scale can be tricky. You have a global userbase, all in different timezones, all with different usage patterns that need to be measured and optimized in realtime. Plus, you want to run experiments to test different approaches and see how they impact retention, but this requires constant code changes, which holds up work on your core product.

Trophy takes away the legwork involved in building features like achievements and streaks and provides reliable, scalable APIs for shipping gamification experiences faster than building in-house. Plus, it provides a web platform to easily configure, measure and experiment with the product experience without constant code changes.
