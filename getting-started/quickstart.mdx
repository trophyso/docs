Here you'll integrate your backend web application with Trophy and start building your first gamified feature.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Trophy account">
    First, [create a new account](https://app.trophy.so/sign-up?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=quickstart) if you don't already have one and head into the [Trophy dashboard](https://app.trophy.so).

    Head through onboarding to get your account set up.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Trophy SDK to your backend">
    We have SDK libraries available in most major programming languages but if you don't see yours listed, let us know and we'll make one!

    <SdkInstallCommand />

    Alternatively, you can directly call the API using any server-side HTTP library.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up environment">
    Add your API key that you created during onboarding (or [create a new one](https://app.trophy.so/integration)) as an environment variable in your backend application:

    <AddEnvVarBlock />

    Make sure to pass this API key to the Trophy SDK or to your API client to authenticate.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first metric">
    All gamification features, like [Achievements](/platform/achievements), [Streaks](/platform/streaks) and [Emails](/platform/emails), are driven by user interactions. In Trophy, you use [Metrics](/platform/metrics) to define those interactions and [Events](/platform/events) to track them. 
    
    Here you'll create your first metric to get started. In thr Trophy dashboard, head into the [metrics page](https://app.trophy.so/metrics) and hit the _New Metric_ button:

    <Frame>
      <video
        autoPlay
        muted
        loop
        playsInline
        className="w-full aspect-video"
        src="../assets/platform/metrics/create_new_metric.mp4"
      ></video>
    </Frame>

    Give the metric a name and hit _Save_.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate the metric into your backend">
    Once you've created your metric, head to the configure tab and copy it's unique API reference key.

    <Frame>
      <video
        autoPlay
        muted
        loop
        playsInline
        className="w-full aspect-video"
        src="../assets/quick-start/copy_metric_key.mp4"
      ></video>
    </Frame>

    To track an event against this metric when a user interacts with your product, call the [metric change event API](/api-reference/endpoints/metrics/send-a-metric-change-event), passing along details of the user that made the interaction. In this example the metric key would be `words-written`:

    <MetricChangeRequestBlock />

    By making this call, you're telling Trophy that a specific user made an interaction with your product. As a result, Trophy will process any gamification features that you've configured against the metric automatically.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Continue building your gamification experience">
    With a metric integrated into your backend, you're ready to start adding gamification features to your product.
    
    Follow the links below to learn more about each feature you can build with Trophy:

    <CardGroup>
      <Card title="Achievements" icon="trophy" href="/platform/achievements">
        Reward users for continued progress or taking specific actions.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Streaks" icon="flame" href="/platform/streaks">
        Motivate users to continue using your platform over time.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Emails" icon="mail" href="/platform/emails">
        Encourage and congratulate users to keep them coming back.
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
