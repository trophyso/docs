Here you'll integrate your backend web application with Trophy and start building your first gamified feature.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Trophy account">
    First, [create a new account](https://app.trophy.so/sign-up?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=quickstart) if you don't already have one and head into the [Trophy dashboard](https://app.trophy.so).

    Head through onboarding to get your account set up.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Trophy SDK to your backend">
    We have SDK libraries available in most major programming languages but if you don't see yours listed, let us know and we'll make one!

    <SdkInstallCommand />

    Alternatively, you can directly call the API using any server-side HTTP library.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up environment">
    Add your API key that you created during onboarding (or [create a new one](https://app.trophy.so/integration)) as an environment variable in your backend application:

    <AddEnvVarBlock />

    Make sure to pass this API key to the Trophy SDK or to your API client to authenticate.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first Metric">
    Nearly all gamification features in Trophy, like [Achievements](/platform/achievements), [Streaks](/platform/streaks) and [Emails](/platform/emails), are driven by [Metrics](/platform/metrics). Here you'll create your first metric to help you get started.
