Trophy provides a core set of primitives to help you ship gamification experiences faster. But gamification is not something you can set and forget.

A key part of running a gamified platform is experimentation â€” tweaking and optimizing the user experience to ensure that users keep coming back.

Usually, you'd have to build these tools yourself, but with Trophy you get an experimentation stack out-of-the-box.

<Note>
  We have plans to extend Trophy's experimentation capibilities in the future to
  support more broad A/B testing of your gamification features.
