## What Is Engagement?

User engagement in Trophy refers to the average level of activity that your users show when using your product.

As Trophy tracks user interactions through [Metrics](/platforms/metrics), it can give you insights into how active your users are against each, and in aggregate.

User engagement in Trophy is the average total metric event value per daily active user. The formula is:

```
sum of all metric event values in a day / number of users active that day
```

## Engagement Analytics

Trophy dashboards for each metric show engagement charts for that metric, and the main Trophy dashboard presents user engagement in aggregate.

Trophy also displays charts that show user engagement within users' first days after signing up for your product.

We refer to this as 'early engagement' and it is user engagement as measured by Trophy only for users within the timeframe set in the 'New User Activation Window' setting on the [integration page](https://app.trophy.so/integration/configure).

This is a useful chart for understanding the engagement of users within their very first days with your product and to understand where blockers to initial user activation may be occurring.
