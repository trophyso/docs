## What Is The Trophy Impact Score?

Trophy has a built-in A/B testing feature that allows you to test the impact of your gamification features on retention and engagement.

Through manipulating the [Control Ratio](#customizing-the-control-ratio), you can assign a certain percentage of your users to a 'control cohort'. Each new user that you tell Trophy about will be automatically assigned to the control cohort or not based on this setting.

Trophy then exposes the `control` attribute through the [GET user API](/api-reference/endpoints/users/get-a-single-user#response-control) to allow developers to hide gamification UI and features from users in the control cohort.

Similarly, if you use the [Emails](/platform/emails) feature, Trophy only sends emails to users who are not in the control cohort.

Trophy then automatically tracks the 14-day retention of the two cohorts and compares them, resulting in the Trophy Impact Score.

The Trophy Impact Score reflects the percentage difference in 14-day retention between the control cohort and the rest of your userbase.

<Tip>
  An Impact Score of 5% means that users enrolled in gamification features are
  5% more likely to be using your platform after 14 days than the control
  cohort.

## Customizing The Control Ratio

By default, Trophy will use a 90/10 ratio of non-control/control users. However, you can customize this as you wish.

If you'd prefer to use a different ratio of control to non-control users then you can do so on the [Integration](https://app.trophy.so/integration) page.

Use the slider to change the percentage of your userbase that will be set as control users and opted out of gamification features.
