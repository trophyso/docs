## What Is Retention?

User retention is the percentage of users who are still using your product after a certain .

Common time frames include 7-day, 14-day and 30-day retention with shorter time frames providing information on initial user experience and longer time frames giving insight into long-term product-market fit.

## Retention Analytics

Trophy includes a retention chart for each metric on its metric dashboard and an aggregate user retention chart on the main dashboard.
