## What is a Points system?

Points systems are used to reward users for taking actions in your product. When rewards are closely aligned with user incentives, they can be a powerful retention feature.

<Tip>
  Use Trophy's [metric analytics](/platform/metrics#metric-analytics) to compare
  the retention of each user interaction, then configure points around these
  interactions to maximize retention impact.
</Tip>

Use Trophy to create sophisticated points systems driven by real user interactions with no custom code.

## Creating Triggers

Points can be awarded as a result of user interactions tracked by Trophy including:

- Awarding points as users increment [Metrics](/platform/metrics) e.g. "earn 10 points for every mile ran".
- Awarding points for reaching [Streak](/platform/streaks) milestones e.g. reaching 7-day, 14-day and 30-day streaks.
- Awarding points for unlocking [Achievements](/platform/achievements).

To create a new points trigger, head to the [points](https://app.trophy.so/points/configure/new) page in the Trophy dashboard and follow the steps below:

<Tip>
  All new points triggers are created as 'Inactive' to allow testing and
  balancing before deployment to production.
</Tip>

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose a trigger type">
  Choose how you want points to be awarded.
  
- Choosing **Metric** will mean points will be automatically awarded to users incrementally as they increase their metric total for a particular metric.

- Choosing **Streak** will mean points will be automatically awarded to users when their streak reaches a specific length.

- Choosing **Achievement** will mean points will be automatically awarded to users when they unlock a specific achievement.

</Step>

<Step title="Set up trigger">
  Once you've chosen the points trigger type, you need to set up the trigger settings.

- If you chose the **Metric** trigger, you'll need to choose the metric, the threshold amount at which to award points, and number of points to award each time the user's total metric value increases by the threshold amount.

- If you chose the **Streak** trigger, you'll need to set the streak length that should award points and the number of points to award to user's when they reach this streak length.

- If you chose the **Achievement** trigger, you'll need to choose the acheivement that should award points when unlocked and the number of points to award.

</Step>

<Step title="Hit save">
  Save the new points trigger.

## Balancing Points

Running an effective points system means ensuring correct balancing. Balancing means making sure users don't earn points too fast or slow. Failure to achieve balancing can result in points fatigue, or boredom which both lead to disengagement with the feature.

Use Trophy's points preview tool to test how points triggers work in practice.

## Displaying Points

There are a few ways to use Trophy to fetch and display points in your app.

Firstly, any points awarded to users are returned in the response when sending metric change events using the (metric change event API](/api-reference/endpoints/metrics/send-a-metric-change-event).

The response includes the users total points, how many points were awarded as a result of the event, and the details of the specific triggers that fired.

Additionally there are a number of APIs that can be used to fetch and display points data in the API. Check the full [API reference](/api-reference/introduction) for details.

## Points Analytics

Trophy has built in analytics to track points awards across your users in real time including:

- Total points earned by all users over time
- Most points earned by a single user
- Average points earned in first 14 days (useful for understanding new user retention patterns and the impact of points)
- A breakdown on the most commonly awarded points triggers
