## What are Leaderboards?

Leaderboards are social competitions between users of your application. Use leaderboards to increase engagement and foster social interaction.

## Types of Leaderboards

Leaderboards in Trophy can be one of a few different types.

### Perpetual Leaderboards

Perpetual leaderboards never reset. Once started they continually track and rank users progress over time forever, or until the configured [end date](#end-dates).

### Repeating Leaderboards

Repeating leaderboards can be configured to reset after any arbitrary number of days, months or years.

In Trophy each instance of a repeating leaderboard is called a **'run'**. For example, a monthly leaderboard would have 12 runs in a year, but a daily leaderboard would have `n` runs in a month where `n` is the number of days in a given month.

Repeating leaderboards reset all ranks at the start of each run giving new users an equal chance to compete with existing users.

Trophy tracks the rankings in each run of a repeating leaderboard individually and provides [APIs](/api-reference/endpoints/leaderboards/get-leaderboard) to fetch ranking data on historical runs.

#### Handling Time Zones

If you have tracked users' [time zones](/platform/users#param-tz) with Trophy, these will be used to ensure that each user has an equal chance of winning no matter where they are in the world.

In practice this means leaderboards are finalized and winners chosen about 12 hours after they naturally finish in UTC to allow time for users in all time zones to make their final push.

#### Tips for Weekly Leaderboards

As the start of the week can be different in different countries, there is some debate about how to manage weekly leaderboards correctly and consistently.

We'll be adding better support for weekly leaderboards in the future based on customer requests, so if that's you [let us know](mailto:support@trophy.so)! However Trophy leaderboards will cover 90% of weekly use cases, so here's what we suggest if you want to set one up.

To create a weekly leaderboard, set up a [repeating leaderboard](#repeating-leaderboards) on a 7 day schedule and set the start date to be the next occurring first day of the week. While you wait for the start date to come around, the leaderboard will be in `scheduled` status and will automatically go live on the start date.

This will make sure each run of the leaderboard consistently tracks the start and end of each week that your users are familiar with.

## Ranking Logic

Leaderboards in Trophy are configurable to rank participants in a number of different ways to support common use cases.

### Ranking Methods

The ranking method of a leaderboard determines on what dimension participants will be ordered.

    width="50%"

    src="../assets/platform/leaderboards/ranking_methods.png"
  />
</Frame>

#### Metric Rankings

Metric leaderboards are linked to an existing Trophy [Metric](/platform/metrics) and rank users based on their progress against it.

Use metric leaderboards if you just want to rank users based on a single interaction.

#### Points Rankings

Points leaderboards are linked to an existing Trophy [Points System](/platform/points) and automatically rank users according to their total points.

Use a points leaderboard if you want to rank users based on a combination of metrics, achievements or other Trophy features.

#### Streak Rankings

Streak leaderboards rank users based on their current streak length.

<Tip>Streak leaderboards can only be [perpetual](#perpetual-leaderboards).</Tip>

### Ranking Breakdowns

If you have a large user base, it's best practice to split up leaderboard participants into smaller, more socially-connected groups. This often leads to higher engagement than when using global leaderboards.

Leaderboards in Trophy can be configured to group users into smaller groups according to a specific [custom user attribute](#custom-user-attributes).

<Tip>
  When using leaderboard breakdowns, [participant limits](#participant-limits)
  apply at the group level, not overall.
</Tip>

To set up a leaderboard breakdown head to the leaderboard configuration page and create or select your user attribute in the 'Breakdown Attribute' field.

Trophy will automatically start grouping users into smaller leaderboards based on the values of your chosen attribute for each of your users.

  ></video>
</Frame>

To fetch rankings for a particular group of users with a specific attribute value, use the [leaderboard rankings API](/api-reference/endpoints/leaderboards/get-leaderboard), specifying the attribute value in the [`userAttributes` parameter](/api-reference/endpoints/leaderboards/get-leaderboard#parameter-user-attributes) as follows:

<LeaderboardSingleAttributeRequest />

If you wish to fetch rankings for a particular group of users with a specific combination of user attributes, create a new attribute to track the combination and use that as your breakdown attribute as follows:

<LeaderboardMultiAttributeRequest />

## Start & End Dates

Use start and end dates to control the window within which leaderboards are actively ranking users.

    height="200"
    width="50%"
    noZoom
    src="../assets/platform/leaderboards/start_end_dates.png"
  />
</Frame>

### Start Dates

Leaderboards in Trophy can be set to start at a future date of your choice. This is often useful to allow some time for last minute changes or adjustments before leaderboards start ranking users.

Leaderboards with a start date in the future are scheduled and automatically go live on the start date you choose.

### End Dates

Leaderboards in Trophy can have end dates. If you set an end date on a leaderboard then after that date it will enter `finished` status and rankings will be finalized and winners chosen.

<Note>
  Due to differences in [time zones](#handling-time-zones), leaderboards can be
  finalized up to 12 hours after the end date in UTC to allow all users to reach
  the end date according to their local clock.
</Note>

## Participant Limits

Leaderboards in Trophy have a maximum number of participants of **1,000**. However a leaderboard can be configured to have any arbitrary number of participants to support use cases like _Top 100_ or similar.

<Frame>
  <img
    height="200"
    width="50%"
    noZoom
    src="../assets/platform/leaderboards/max_participants.png"
  />
</Frame>

If a leaderboard already has a number of participants that matches its configured maximum, new users will have to surpass the score of the lowest rank to join the leaderboard.

<Tip>
We chose to limit leaderboard size to help guide customers on best practice.

Traditionally, leaderboards with lots of participants fail to engage users beyond the top 1%, and have a **negative** impact on users in the bottom half, particularly new users. To avoid this, keep your leaderboards small by breaking them down into smaller leaderboards using breakdown attributes(#ranking-breakdowns).

For more background on the negative effects on global leaderboards, read this [blog post](https://www.trophy.so/blog/leaderboard-only-motivating-top-one-percent).

</Tip>

The only exception to this is when using [breakdown attributes](#ranking-breakdowns) to group participants into smaller cohorts. When using breakdown attributes the participant limit applies to each group, not overall.

## Managing Leaderboards

Leaderboards in Trophy have a number of statuses to help you control when users and how users can join them.

### Leaderboard Statuses

Leaderboards can have one of the following statuses:

- `Inactive`
- `Scheduled`
- `Active`
- `Finished`
- `Archived`

All new leaderboards are created as `Inactive`. While inactive, any properties or settings of the leaderboard can be changed, they won't be visible to users and users can't join them.

Once you're ready for users to start participating, you can make it `Active`. This means Trophy will start tracking users' activity and entering them into leaderboards.

Leaderboards that have been configured with a [start date](#start-dates) in the future can't be made active, they can only be `Scheduled`. Once the start date is past, Trophy will automatically make them `Active` and start accepting participants.

If a leaderboard has an [end date](#end-dates), then once it has past Trophy will automatically move it to `Finished` status and stop monitoring user activity. Once a leaderboard has finished it won't be visible to users but you can still query APIs to get rankings for historical runs.

If you decide you no longer need a leaderboard, you can move it to `Archived` status.

<Warning>
  Once a leaderboard is archived, it can only be restored by contacting support.
