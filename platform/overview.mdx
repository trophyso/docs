Trophy is built around a set of key concepts that all gamification experiences have in common, while still offering enough customization for you to build any kind of gamified experience you need.

## Platform Concepts

Trophy's platform concepts are scalable building blocks that support all of Trophy's features and are the main things for developers to get comfortable with.
