The Trophy Admin API is a set of endpoints that support customers in driving additional custom workflows using Trophy data including building custom integrations and running background processes.

The Admin API is accessible through **the same SDKs** as the [Application API](/api-reference/introduction) or, for those who manage their own HTTP clients, is available at the following base URL.

```bash Base URL
https://admin.trophy.so/v1
```
