The Trophy Admin API is a set of endpoints for building custom gamification workflows. 

While the [Application API](/api-reference/introduction) models the data and interactions required to deliver a gamification experience in-app, the Admin API models administrative actions that are only performed by your team or business logic outside of your application.

The Admin API is accessible through **the same SDKs** as the Application API or, for those who manage their own HTTP clients, is available at the following base URL.

```bash Base URL
https://admin.trophy.so/v1
```
