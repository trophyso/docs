The Trophy API is a set of endpoints that provide simple interfaces for building gamification experiences, taking care of the tricky bits behind the scenes while being flexible enough to support any gamification use case.

There are no usage limits or paywalls, and everybody has access to the exact same API to build to their hearts content.
