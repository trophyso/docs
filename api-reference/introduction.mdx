The Trophy Application API is a set of endpoints that provide simple interfaces for building gamification experiences and covers the full range of actions that an end user of your application can perform.

It does not include global administrative functions or actions that should only be performed by your internal systems. If you are looking for admin functionality, please refer to the [Admin API](/admin-api/introduction).

The Application API is accessible through [SDKs](/api-reference/client-libraries) available in most major programming languages or, for those who wish manage their own HTTP clients, is available at the following base URL.

```bash Base URL
https://api.trophy.so/v1
```
