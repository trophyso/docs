import { RateLimitBadge } from "/snippets/rate-limit-badge.jsx";

Trophy operates a tiered rate limiting model for each API endpoint. All rate limits are scoped at the organisation level. Exceeding rate limits will result in your application receiving a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Rate Limit Tiers

| Tier | Rate Limit |
| ---- | ---------- |
| <RateLimitBadge tier={1} noTooltip /> | 10 req/s |
| <RateLimitBadge tier={2} noTooltip /> | 100 req/s |

<Tip>
  If you feel you need a higher rate limit, then please [contact
  us](mailto:support@trophy.so) and we'll be happy to discuss your needs.
