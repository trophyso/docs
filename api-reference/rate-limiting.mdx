At time of writing, Trophy has no API rate limits. We do however monitor usage closely to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage throughout the platform.

If in the future we do implement rate limits, the levels and conditions at which they may be met will be listed here and we'll always inform you ahead of time of any such updates.
