Trophy currently rate limits requests to **60 requests/second** for all endpoints.

Rate limiting is scoped at the organisation level as defined by the API key used in requests.

<Tip>
  If you feel you need a higher rate limit, then please [contact
  us](mailto:support@trophy.so) and we'll be happy to supporting your needs.
