## Invite Your team

Trophy supports up to 5 team members per organization. However if you feel you need more [just ask](mailto:support@trophy.so) and we'll be happy to give you more room.

To invite a team member to your Trophy organization, open up the organization management dialog and head into the _Members_ tab:

<Frame>
  <video
    autoPlay
    muted
    loop
    playsInline
    className="w-full aspect-15/4"
    src="../assets/account/members/add_new_member.mp4"
  ></video>
</Frame>

Hit _Invite_ and add the email address of the team member(s) you want to invite. If you're an account admin, you can add other admins, otherwise you'll only be able to add other members.

Once you're happy, hit _Send invitations_ and each team member will receive an email invitation to Trophy.

## Manage User Roles

<Note>Only organization admins can manage user roles</Note>

Every team member in your Trophy organization has one of two roles:

- Admin: Can perform all account operations, including organization management and adding new admins.
- Member: Can perform all account operations, and add new members.

By default, the person who first set up Trophy will become the first admin. However you can change the role of any user at any time.

To manage roles, open up the organization management dialog and head into the _Members_ tab:

<Frame>
  <video
    autoPlay
    muted
    loop
    playsInline
    className="w-full aspect-15/4"
    src="../assets/account/members/manage_roles.mp4"
  ></video>
</Frame>

Here you can promote any existing member to an admin, or demote any existing admin to a member.
