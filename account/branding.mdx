## Configure Branding

- **Logo**: Upload your brandâ€™s logo to be displayed in the header of Trophy emails. We recommend using a horizontal logo with a transparent background or a plain background color with rounded corners.
- **Font**: The default font used in Trophy emails.
- **Brand Color**: Choose a primary color for your brand. Trophy will use this color for buttons and other elements in your emails.
- **App Name**: Enter the name of your app or service. Trophy will use this name in various places in your emails.
- **App URL**: Enter a default URL to use when not overridden on a per-email basis. Usually this is the URL of your app or service's sign in page.
