## Usage-based Billing

Trophy follows a monthly usage-based pricing model where customers only pay for the _units_ of usage they consume. For Trophy a _unit_ of usage corresponds to a single **Monthly Active User (MAU)**.

## Monthly Active Users (MAUs)

Trophy defines an MAU as a single user that is involved in at least one API call in a given month. You'll be charged a flat rate per MAU, that diminishes the more MAUs you have. Here's full details of the model:

| MAUs          | Cost per MAU ($) |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| < 1,000       | -                |
| 1,000 - 5,000 | 0.02             |
| 5,000+        | 0.01             |

<Note>
  Bear in mind **you never pay for churned users**. If a user signs up to your
  product in a given month, but doesn't use it again in subsequent months, you
  only pay for that user in the first month, and never again.
</Note>

You can estimate your monthly cost based on your current MAUs using our [calculator](https://www.trophy.so/pricing), but here are some common examples:

| MAUs    | Cost ($) |
| ------- | -------- |
| 1,000   | 49       |
| 5,000   | 129      |
| 10,000  | 179      |
| 50,000  | 579      |
| 100,000 | 1079     |
