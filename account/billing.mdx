## Usage-based Billing

Trophy follows a usage-based pricing model where customers only pay for the units of usage they consume. For Trophy, a unit of usage corresponds to a single [Monthly Active User](##monthly-active-users-maus) (MAU).

## Monthly Active Users (MAUs)

Trophy defines an MAU as a single user that is involved in at least one API call in a given month.

<Note>
  Bear in mind **you never pay for churned users**. If a user signs up to your
  product in a given month but doesn't return, you only pay for that user once
  and never again.
</Note>

## Free tier

All customers start on the free tier. This allows dev teams to build and test implementations for up to **100 MAUs** without accurring any usage charges.

<Note>
  If you exceed the free plan, don't panic! Nothing will stop working, we'll
  just reach out to you with a friendly reminder to add a payment method.
</Note>

## Estimating Costs

You'll be charged a flat rate of `$49` + `$0.015` / MAU (USD) above the [Free Tier](#free-tier). You can estimate your monthly charges using our [calculator](https://www.trophy.so/pricing), but here are some common examples:

| MAUs      | Cost (USD) |
| --------- | ---------- |
| `100`     | `0`        |
| `1,000`   | `62.5`     |
| `5,000`   | `122.5`    |
| `10,000`  | `197.5`    |
| `50,000`  | `797.5`    |
| `100,000` | `1,547.5`  |
