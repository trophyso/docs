## Usage-based Billing

Trophy follows a usage-based pricing model where customers only pay for the units of usage they consume. For Trophy, a unit of usage corresponds to a single [Monthly Active User](##monthly-active-users-maus) (MAU).

<Info>
  See our [pricing page](https://trophy.so/pricing) to get an estimate of your
  costs based on your expected usage.
</Info>

## Monthly Active Users (MAUs)

Trophy defines an MAU as a single user that sends at least one [metric event](/platform/events) to Trophy in a given month.

<Tip>
  Bear in mind **you never pay for churned users**. If a user signs up for your
  product in a given month but doesn't return, you only pay for that user once
  and never again.
</Tip>

## Free Tier

The free tier allows teams to test and evaluate Trophy up to **100 MAUs** without accruing usage charges.

<Tip>
  Once you exceed the free plan, your account will continue to function and
  we'll reach out to you directly with a friendly reminder to upgrade.
</Tip>

## Paid Plans

Trophy has two paid plans, [Starter](#starter-plan) and [Pro](#pro-plan).

### Starter Plan

The starter plan is for customers who have graduated from the testing and evaluation phase and are using Trophy in small-scale production deployments.

Unlike the [Free Tier](#free-tier), the starter plan has no limits on MAUs.

<Tip>
  Beyond ~`16,000` MAUs it's usually more cost-efficient to upgrade to the [Pro
  Plan](#pro-plan).
</Tip>

### Pro Plan

The pro plan is for customers who are using Trophy in larger scale deployments or who require more advanced [features](#features).

### Plan Allowances

Here's a comparison of the allowances of each paid plan:

| Item                        | Starter | Pro      |
| --------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| Base price                  | `$99`   | `$299`   |
| Included MAUs               | `1,000` | `10,000` |
| Included Emails             | `5,000` | `50,000` |
| Included Push Notifications | `5,000` | `50,000` |

### Overages

Overages are charged on paid plans above the included [allowances](#plan-allowances) at the following rates:

| Item                     | Starter  | Pro      |
| ------------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| 1 MAU                    | `$0.015` | `$0.015` |
| 1,000 Emails             | `$2.50`  | `$2.00`  |
| 1,000 Push Notifications | `$1.50`  | `$1.00`  |
