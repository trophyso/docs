## Usage-based Billing

Trophy follows a usage-based pricing model where customers only pay for the units of usage they consume. For Trophy, a unit of usage corresponds to a single [Monthly Active User](##monthly-active-users-maus) (MAU).

## Monthly Active Users (MAUs)

Trophy defines an MAU as a single user that is involved in at least one API call in a given month.

<Tip>
  Bear in mind **you never pay for churned users**. If a user signs up to your
  product in a given month but doesn't return, you only pay for that user once
  and never again.
</Tip>

## Free Tier

The free tier allows teams to test and evaluate Trophy up to **100 MAUs** without accruing usage charges.

<Note>
  Once you exceed the free plan, your account will continue to function and
  we'll reach out to you directly with a friendly reminder to upgrade.
</Note>

## Paid Plans

Trophy has two paid plans, [Starter](#starter-plan) and [Pro](#pro-plan).

### Starter Plan

The starter plan is for customers who have graduated from the testing and evaluation phase and are using Trophy in small-scale production deployments.

Unlike the [Free Tier](#free-tier), the starter plan has no limits on MAUs.

<Tip>
  Beyond ~ `16,000` MAUs it's usually more cost-efficient to upgrade to the [Pro
  Plan](#pro-plan).
</Tip>

### Pro Plan

The pro plan is for customers who are using Trophy in larger scale deployments or who require more advanced [features](#features).

### Plan Limits

Here's a comparison of the limits of each paid plan:

| Item            | Starter | Pro      |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| Base price ($)  | `99`    | `299`    |
| Included MAUs   | `1,000` | `10,000` |
| Included emails | `5,000` | `50,000` |
