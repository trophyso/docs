## Motivation

Gamification is a core part of any educational platform. When done right, it's proven by platform like Duolingo to consistently engage students and boost retention.

This example app serves as a template for a web application that provides students a way to practice flashcards. Feel free to use this example app to start a new ed-tech project, or just as inspiration.

If you'd prefer you can follow the step-by-step [tutorial](/guides/tutorials/how-to-build-a-gamified-study-platform), and to see it working in practice you can check out the [live demo (TBD)](https://example.com).

## Tech Stack

The tech stack for this example study platform is as follows:

- NextJS 15 (React 19)
- Shadcn/Ui
- LottieFiles for animations
- Lucide for iconography
- (TBD) for sound effects
- Trophy for gamification

Here we let you choose your own data storage provider and just include in-memory data for simplicity.

## Gamification Strategy

We've built Trophy into this example study platform to demonstrate how easy it makes it to build gamification experiences.

Here's a breakdown of the gamification features used in this example project.

### Multi-stage Acheivements

This example study platform uses multi-stage achievements based on the following milestones:

- 10 flashcards viewed
- 50 flashcards viewed
- 100 flashcards viewed
- 250 flashcards viewed
- 500 flashcards viewed

Each time a user reaches a milestone:

- A new badge appears in their account
- They receive an in-app notification
- They hear a sound effect

### Daily Streaks

This example project also uses daily streaks where users must look at least one flashcard a day to keep their streak. For each consequtive day the user looks at least one flashcard, their streak increases. But if they miss a day, they lose their streak and have to start over.

The users current streak is displayed in their profile and each time they successfully extend their streak the following occurs:

- They recieve an in-app notification
- They hear a sound effect

### Automated Email Sequences

Emails are automtically sent to users to support the following use cases:

- Congratulating users when they unlock new achievements
- Summarizing progress on a weekly basis

## Trophy Setup

To make all this gamification possible, and to save time on writing custom code, this example app makes use of Trophy's gamification platform.

To replicate the same features, the following Trophy resources are required:

| Trophy Resource    | Name                  | Notes            |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Metric             | Flashcards Completed  | -                |
| Achievement        | 10 Flashcards Viewed  | Linked to metric |
| Achievement        | 50 Flashcards Viewed  | Linked to metric |
| Achievement        | 100 Flashcards Viewed | Linked to metric |
| Achievement        | 250 Flashcards Viewed | Linked to metric |
| Achievement        | 500 Flashcards Viewed | Linked to metric |
| Achievement        | Profile Completed     | -                |
| Daily Streak       | -                     | Linked to metric |
| Achievement Emails | -                     | Switched On      |
| Recap Emails       | -                     | Switched On      |
