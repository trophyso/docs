## Motivation

Gamification is a core part of any educational platform. When done right, it's proven by platforms like Duolingo to consistently engage students and boost retention.

This example app serves as a template for a web application that provides students a way to practice flashcards. Feel free to use this example app to start a new ed-tech project, or just as inspiration.

If you'd prefer you can follow the step-by-step [tutorial](/guides/tutorials/how-to-build-a-gamified-study-platform), and to see it working in practice you can check out the [live demo](https://study.examples.trophy.so).

## Tech Stack

The tech stack for this example study platform is as follows:

- [NextJS 15](https://nextjs.org/docs) (React 19)
- [Shadcn/Ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons) for iconography
- [Motion](https://motion.dev/) for animations
- [HTML5 Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) for sound effects
- [Trophy](https://trophy.so) for gamification

You can choose your own data storage provider but the purposes of the tutorial we'll just use in-memory data for simplicity.

## Gamification Strategy

The example app uses Trophy to demonstrate how easy it is to build gamification experiences. Here's a breakdown of the gamification features used:

### Multi-stage Acheivements

The example app features multi-stage achievements with the following milestones:

- 10 flashcards viewed
- 50 flashcards viewed
- 100 flashcards viewed
- 250 flashcards viewed
- 500 flashcards viewed

Each time a user reaches a milestone the following occurs:

- A new badge is displayed in their account
- An in-app notification is shown
- A sound effect is played

All the progress tracking is done by Trophy behind the scenes to keep focus on buiding out a great user experience.

### Daily Streaks

The example project also uses daily streaks where users must look at least one flashcard a day to keep their streak. For each consequtive day the user looks at least one flashcard, their streak increases. But if they miss a day, they lose their streak and have to start over.

Again, Trophy handles all the streak tracking and calculations behind the scenes to keep focus on the experience. Each time a user successfully extends their streak the following happens:

- An in-app notification is shown
- A sound effect is played

### Automated Email Sequences

The example app also has emails automtically sent to users to based on the following use cases:

- Congratulating users when they unlock new achievements
- Summarizing progress on a weekly basis

Again, Trophy handles all the tricky parts around scheduling and sending emails and keeps focus on our core application.

## Trophy Setup

To make all this possible, the [tutorial](/guides/tutorials/how-to-build-a-gamified-study-platform) walks through creating the following resources in a new Trophy account.

| Trophy Resource    | Name                  | Notes            |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Metric             | Flashcards Completed  | -                |
| Achievement        | 10 Flashcards Viewed  | Linked to metric |
| Achievement        | 50 Flashcards Viewed  | Linked to metric |
| Achievement        | 100 Flashcards Viewed | Linked to metric |
| Achievement        | 250 Flashcards Viewed | Linked to metric |
| Achievement        | 500 Flashcards Viewed | Linked to metric |
| Achievement        | Profile Completed     | -                |
| Daily Streak       | -                     | Linked to metric |
| Achievement Emails | -                     | Switched On      |
| Recap Emails       | -                     | Switched On      |

Follow the [Quick Start](/getting-started/quickstart) guide to get your Trophy account set up and start building out this example.
