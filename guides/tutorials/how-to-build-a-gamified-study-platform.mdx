In this tutorial I build out an example study platform using Trophy for gamification.

If you want to just skip to the end then feel free to check out the [template repository](https://github.com/trophyso/example-study-platform) or the [live demo (TBD)](https://example.com).

## Tech Stack

- NextJS 15 (React 19)
- Shadcn/Ui
- LottieFiles for animations
- Lucide for iconography
- (TBD) for sound effects
- Trophy for gamification

## Pre-requisites

- A Trophy account

## Setup & Installation

<Tip>

</Tip>

First we need to create a new NextJS project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Feel free to configure this new project however you like but for the purposes of this tutorial I pretty much stuck with the defaults:

```bash
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes
Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) Yes
Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?  Yes
Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No
```

Next, I initialized a new install of everyones favourite UI library, shadcn/ui:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

I ran into a warning with React 19, which [looks to be a common issue](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/react-19) when initializing with `npm`:

```bash
It looks like you are using React 19.
Some packages may fail to install due to peer dependency issues in npm (see https://ui.shadcn.com/react-19).

? How would you like to proceed? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   Use --force
    Use --legacy-peer-deps
```

For the purposes of this tutorial I chose `--force` but you should use whichever setting you feel suits your requirements.

## Setting up data

For the purposes of this tutorial, we're going to be using some simple types with an in-memory data store. In a production application you'd probably want to consider storing this information in a database.

Here we'll have a very simple type that stores information about each flashcard where we'll use the `front` property to store questions that the student wants to learn the answer to, and the `back` property to store the answers to each question:

```ts src/types/flashcard.ts
export interface Flashcard {
  id: string;
  front: string;
  back: string;
}
```

Then to get us started we'll store a few flashcards in memory centered around learning capital cities:

```ts src/data.ts [expandable]
import { Flashcard } from "./types/flashcard";

export const flashcards: Flashcard[] = [
  {
    id: "1",
    front: "What is the capital of France?",
    back: "Paris",
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    front: "What is the capital of Germany?",
    back: "Berlin",
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    front: "What is the capital of Italy?",
    back: "Rome",
  },
  {
    id: "4",
    front: "What is the capital of Spain?",
    back: "Madrid",
  },
  {
    id: "5",
    front: "What is the capital of Portugal?",
    back: "Lisbon",
  },
  {
    id: "6",
    front: "What is the capital of Greece?",
    back: "Athens",
  },
  {
    id: "7",
    front: "What is the capital of Turkey?",
    back: "Ankara",
  },
  {
    id: "8",
    front: "What is the capital of Poland?",
    back: "Warsaw",
  },
  {
    id: "9",
    front: "What is the capital of Romania?",
    back: "Bucharest",
  },
  {
    id: "10",
    front: "What is the capital of Bulgaria?",
    back: "Sofia",
  },
  {
    id: "11",
    front: "What is the capital of Hungary?",
    back: "Budapest",
  },
  {
    id: "12",
    front: "What is the capital of Czechia?",
    back: "Prague",
  },
  {
    id: "13",
    front: "What is the capital of Slovakia?",
    back: "Bratislava",
  },
  {
    id: "14",
    front: "What is the capital of Croatia?",
    back: "Zagreb",
  },
  {
    id: "15",
    front: "What is the capital of Serbia?",
    back: "Belgrade",
  },
  {
    id: "16",
    front: "What is the capital of Montenegro?",
    back: "Podgorica",
  },
  {
    id: "17",
    front: "What is the capital of North Macedonia?",
    back: "Skopje",
  },
  {
    id: "18",
    front: "What is the capital of Kosovo?",
    back: "Pristina",
  },
  {
    id: "19",
    front: "What is the capital of Albania?",
    back: "Tirana",
  },
  {
    id: "20",
    front: "What is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina?",
    back: "Sarajevo",
  },
];
```

## Basic Flashcard Layout

With some basic data set up, we need to add a way for users to flick through their flashcards.

For this we'll use the Carousel and the Card components from shadcn/ui and for that we need to add these to our project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add carousel card
```

Then, we'll add a new `<Flashcards />` component that combines these into a working solution, specifying that we can pass along any list of `Flashcard` objects as props

```tsx src/app/flashcards.tsx [expandable]
import {
  Carousel,
  CarouselContent,
  CarouselItem,
  CarouselPrevious,
  CarouselNext,
} from "@/components/ui/carousel";
import { Card, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Flashcard } from "@/types/flashcard";

interface Props {
  flashcards: Flashcard[];
}

export default function Flashcards({ flashcards }: Props) {
  return (
    <Carousel className="w-full max-w-md">
      <CarouselContent>
        {flashcards.map((flashcard) => (
          <CarouselItem key={flashcard.id}>
            <div className="p-1">
              <Card>
                <CardContent className="flex items-center justify-center p-6">
                  <span className="text-4xl text-center font-semibold">
                    {flashcard.front}
                  </span>
                </CardContent>
              </Card>
            </div>
          </CarouselItem>
        ))}
      </CarouselContent>
      <CarouselPrevious />
      <CarouselNext />
    </Carousel>
  );
}
```

Then we'll update our `page.tsx` file to display our `<Flashcards />` component, passing in our example data:

```tsx src/app/page.tsx
import { flashcards } from "@/data";
import Flashcards from "./flashcards";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-screen">
      <Flashcards flashcards={flashcards} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

At the end of this step, you should have a working flashcard UI that allows you to flick through each flashcard in our cities data set.
